Placeholder location to put in datasets. Datasets are retreived based on the `config.yml` file.

Raw data can be downloaded from: https://doi.org/10.5683/SP2/FJWIL8, specifically the file named: `mwt_data.zip` which contains plate-level information for the 87 assayed strains plus N2 controls. Extract the content of this archive either here, or elsewhere and update the dataset variable in the `config.yml` to point to where the directories are.
