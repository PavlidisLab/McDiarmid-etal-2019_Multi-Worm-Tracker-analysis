Files in the `datasets/` directory are processed raw data for downstream analysis.

Preprocessed data can also be obtained from our lab dataverse. See https://doi.org/10.5683/SP2/FJWIL8 and select the .zip archive `processed_data.zip`, and unpack it in the `data` path defined in `config.yml` (by default, the `processed_data/` directory from the project root).
