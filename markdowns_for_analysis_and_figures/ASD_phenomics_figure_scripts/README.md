Markdown files for analysis and figure reproduction.

Some documents require processed data: See https://doi.org/10.5683/SP2/FJWIL8 and select the .zip archive `processed_data.zip`, and unpack it in the `data` path defined in `config.yml` (by default, the `processed_data/` directory from the project root) or alternatively, populate the `dataset` directory with the raw data instead (`mwt_data.zip` from the same link) and reprocess the data locally using `main.sh` or `main.R`.

Additional data is required for follow-up experiment figures markdowns: See https://doi.org/10.5683/SP2/FJWIL8 and select the .zip archives matching the markdowns of interest (if applicable).
